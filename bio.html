There was a strict eating regiment that we had to stick to and attempt to make different combinations. There was only a few items that we were allowed to eat and it became difficult, so I began researching what kind of clean carbohydrates we could eatand yet still follow our diets to a “T.” My family being Hispanic, were accustomed to eating starchy tortilla with every meal and yet coming from a family that has had diabetes for generations I wanted to break the cycle and do something about it. I started researching healthy alternatives to corn based tortillas and made the discovery of OATMEAL tortillas. These were a game changer to me and my family because at last we had found something that was familiar to our old diet and yet was good for us. After many attempts of trial and error, I found the perfect recipe that had the feel of corn tortillas but was a delicious alternative. After having my family try them and falling inlove, I gave some to my friends at the gym to try and incorporate into their diets. They went crazy for them. Next thing I knew, I was receiving messages from people at different gyms that had heard great things about the tortillas and wanted to place an order to save them from the same boring food they had to eat every day. My family urged me to start an oatmeal tortilla business to help people turn a new leaf in their diets and help people break generational health issues just like me.</p><p class="bio__name" data-aos="fade-right">- Cinthya Espinoza</p><p class="bio__name" data-aos="fade-right">EZ Oats Founder</p></div><footer class="ben"><span>© 2021, Ez Oats by Cinthya - </span><a href="#">Refund Policy</a></footer></section></main><script src="js/scripts-min.js?t=1632341997670"></script></body></html>
