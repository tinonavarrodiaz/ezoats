      h3(data-aos="fade-right") How it all started
      p(data-aos="fade-right") When my family and I began going to the gym, we had to change our diets for<br> the better. There was a strict eating regiment that we had to stick to and attempt to<br> make different combinations. There was only a few items that we were allowed to<br> eat and it became difficult, so I began researching what kind of clean<br> carbohydrates we could eatand yet still follow our diets to a “T.” My family being<br> Hispanic, were accustomed to eating starchy tortilla with every meal and yet<br> coming from a family that has had diabetes for generations I wanted to break the<br> cycle and do something about it. I started researching healthy alternatives to corn<br> based tortillas and made the discovery of OATMEAL tortillas. These were a game<br> changer to me and my family because at last we had found something that was<br> familiar to our old diet and yet was good for us. After many attempts of trial and<br> error, I found the perfect recipe that had the feel of corn tortillas but was a<br> delicious alternative. After having my family try them and falling inlove, I gave<br> some to my friends at the gym to try and incorporate into their diets. They went<br> crazy for them. Next thing I knew, I was receiving messages from people at<br> different gyms that had heard great things about the tortillas and wanted to place<br> an order to save them from the same boring food they had to eat every day. My<br> family urged me to start an oatmeal tortilla business to help people turn a new<br> leaf in their diets and help people break generational health issues just like me.
